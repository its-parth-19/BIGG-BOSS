               <p>Femina Miss India Manipur 2018 fame Nimrit Kaur Ahluwalia, who rose to fame with Choti Sardarni, is a part of Bigg Boss 16. The actress quit the daily soap earlier this year owing to health issues. She told BT, "I feel the medium we are a part of requires a certain kind of commitment. I have faced different situations, constantly pushed myself and given more than 100 per cent while shooting. But sometimes in life, it becomes important to choose yourself and your well-being. I have spent three years on the set and I wish I could have continued, but that wouldn’t have been fair to myself. I needed to take time off."</p>
